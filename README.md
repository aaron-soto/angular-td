## Project Overview üìñ

Welcome to my Angular Tower Defense game! This interactive game challenges players to strategically place defense towers to protect their base from waves of advancing enemies. Utilizing the A\* pathfinding algorithm, enemies dynamically navigate from their base towards the player's base, recalculating their routes whenever a tower obstructs their path.

Players can engage with a robust tower system, where they can select, place, and upgrade towers using currency earned by defeating enemies. Each tower has unique capabilities and stats, which can be viewed by clicking on the towers in-game. The difficulty escalates with each wave, introducing progressively tougher enemies, demanding keen strategic planning and resource management.

This project not only showcases real-time strategy elements but also demonstrates complex algorithm implementation and state management in Angular, offering an engaging and challenging experience for players. Dive into the game to test your tactical skills and defend your base against the relentless waves of enemies!
