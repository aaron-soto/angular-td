# Tower Defense üöÄ

## Introduction üëã

Welcome to my project, **Angular Tower Defense**! This project is part of my personal portfolio. I designed and built this to demonstrate my skills and growth as a developer. Here, you'll find details about the project, how to set it up locally, and the technologies I used.

Feel free to check out the [previous live version here](!https://aaron-soto.github.io/tower-defense/) or the code for that project [here](!https://github.com/aaron-soto/tower-defense).

## Project Overview üìñ

Welcome to my Angular Tower Defense game! This interactive game challenges players to strategically place defense towers to protect their base from waves of advancing enemies. Utilizing the A\* pathfinding algorithm, enemies dynamically navigate from their base towards the player's base, recalculating their routes whenever a tower obstructs their path.

Players can engage with a robust tower system, where they can select, place, and upgrade towers using currency earned by defeating enemies. Each tower has unique capabilities and stats, which can be viewed by clicking on the towers in-game. The difficulty escalates with each wave, introducing progressively tougher enemies, demanding keen strategic planning and resource management.

This project not only showcases real-time strategy elements but also demonstrates complex algorithm implementation and state management in Angular, offering an engaging and challenging experience for players. Dive into the game to test your tactical skills and defend your base against the relentless waves of enemies!

## Features ‚ú®

Here are some of the standout features of the project:

This tower defense game is packed with engaging features that enhance gameplay and provide a challenging strategic experience:

- **Dynamic Pathfinding**: Enemies use the A\* algorithm to navigate the battlefield, updating their paths dynamically when obstacles (towers) are placed, showcasing advanced AI behavior in gameplay.

- **Interactive Tower System**: Players can select from a variety of towers, each with unique abilities and upgrade options. Towers can be placed strategically to defend against enemies, and players can click on towers to view detailed information about their capabilities.

- **Economic Strategy**: A robust money system is integrated, where players earn currency by defeating enemies. This currency can be used to purchase and upgrade towers, adding a layer of strategic financial management to the game.

- **Progressive Difficulty**: The game features an automated wave system that gradually increases in difficulty, challenging players to continuously improve their strategies and tower placements as they advance through higher levels.

- **Real-time Strategy Elements**: Real-time decisions are crucial in this game since placing a tower in the way of enemies will change their path, requiring players to think quickly and adapt their strategies to evolving scenarios and enemy tactics.

- **Engaging User Interface**: A user-friendly and visually appealing interface that provides smooth navigation and accessibility, enhancing player interaction and overall experience.
